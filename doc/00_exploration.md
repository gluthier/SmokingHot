	- [Quality Criteria for Serious Games: Serious Part, Game Part, and Balance](https://games.jmir.org/2020/3/e19037) "First, high-quality serious games should keep the characterizing goal in focus and should use appropriate methods for the specific application area and target group. Serious games should provide suitable feedback so that players can assess their progress and work towards achieving the characterizing goal. The effectiveness of serious games should be proven in scientific studies or by winning game awards. Second, high-quality serious games should be fun and enjoyable. They must ensure player engagement and should keep the players in flow (ability vs skills). Finally, the double mission of serious games, that is, the balance between the serious and the game part, must be ensured. Therefore, high-quality serious games should embed the characterizing goal into the gameplay so that engaging in the serious part is mandatory for playing the game. Furthermore, the interaction technology should be suitable for the target group and game purpose"
